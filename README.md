# Hypertension Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning and PPG Signal Analysis

Author: The project is developed by **Nguyen Thanh Tai** as part of the Undergraduate Final Year Project at **Greenwich Vietnam FPT University**.

This Final Project uses **machine learning** to classify and predict hypertension stages based on **Photoplethysmography (PPG)** signals and **physiological data**. The project implement various machine learning models, deep learning algorithm, and a user-friendly GUI for real-time predictions, data processing and model performance visualization.

## Introduction

Hypertension is a leading cause of early mortality globally. This project aims to:

- Develop a machine learning pipeline capable of classifying hypertension stages: **Normal, Prehypertension, Stage 1 Hypertension, and Stage 2 Hypertension** based on PPG waveform data and physiological factors such as blood pressure, age, BMI, etc.
- Utilize PPG signals and physiological data for predictions.
- Create a GUI to make predictions accessible and actionable for easier model performance visualization.

## Features

- **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**:

  - Perform statistical analysis on data, identify distributions, and handle missing values.
  - Clean and transform data, encode categorical features, and label hypertension stages.
  - Finding relationships between features and performing multivariate visualization.

- **Machine Learning Models**:

  - Train and evaluate multiple models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Naive Bayes.
  - Optimize models using hyperparameter tuning and GridSearchCV.
  - Perform model evaluation, clustering, and visualization

- **Signal Processing**:

  - Assess signal quality using Skewness Signal Quality Index (SQI) to identify high-quality PPG signals.
  - Normalize signal amplitudes and extract time-domain and frequency-domain features.

- **Deep Learning**:

  - Develop and train Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models for advanced predictions.
  - Evaluate performance using metrics like loss, accuracy, and confusion matrices.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
  - Interactive GUI built with Streamlit for real-time data analysis and predictions.
  - Allow users to upload datasets, select features, choose machine learning models, and view detailed performance metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrices.
